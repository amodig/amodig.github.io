= Trying out HubPress
:hp-tags: hubpress, blog, open source,

I decided to try out a fairly new blogging platform which makes it easy to post static content written in link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] on GitHub Pages. Let's see how this works. I'm planning to write about general data science and other technical stuff, but it may replace my link:https://thoughtwisp.wordpress.com/[WordPress blog] -- which I haven't updated in a long time -- for musings in film, music and art.
